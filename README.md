# Digital circuit Design to find square root of a positve number
 Binary search algorithm and repeated subtraction algorithm are used to implement the digital circuit design.
-  Verilog code is written that takes positive number as input and outputs integral part of its square root.
-  Binary search algorithm is used for designing  FSM  and  Repetitive subtraction algorithm  is used for division.
